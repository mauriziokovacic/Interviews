# Not occurring integer

Write a function:
```
int solution(int A[], int N)
```
that, given an array $A$ of $N$ integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than $0$) that does not occur in $A$.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
- $N$ is an integer within the range $[1, 100000]$
- each element of array $A$ is an integer within the range $[âˆ’1000000, 1000000]$

## Example
```
A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2]
```

### Expected output
$5$


## Example
```
A = [1, 2, 3]
```

### Expected output
$4$

## Example
```
A = [-1, -3]
```

### Expected output
$1$
