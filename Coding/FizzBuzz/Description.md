# FizzBuzz

You have to implement the function
```
void fizzBuzz(int n)
```
that given a number `n`, for each integer `i` in the range from $1$ to `n` (_inclusive_), print one value per line as follows:
- if `i` is a multiple of both $3$ and $5$, print _FizzBuzz_.
- if `i` is a multiple of $3$ (but not $5$), print _Fizz_.
- if `i` is a multiple of $5$ (but not $3$), print _Buzz_.
- if `i` is not a multiple of $3$ or $5$, print the value of `i`


## Constraints
$0 < n < 2\cdot 10^5$


## Example
Given `n = 15`, the function `fizzBuzz` should print:
```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
```
