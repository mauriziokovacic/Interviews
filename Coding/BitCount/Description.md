# Bit count

Write a function:

    int solution(int A, int B)

that, given two non-negative integers $A$ and $B$, returns the number of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of the number $A \cdot B$.

For example, given $A = 3$ and $B = 7$ the function should return 3, because the binary representation of $A \cdot B = 3 \cdot 7 = 21$ is `10101` and it contains three bits set to 1.

Assume that:
- $A$ and $B$ are integers within the range $[0, 100000000]$.

In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment
